# Haberman Case Study: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Haberman Breast Cancer Survival Dataset, focusing on the relationship between axillary lymph nodes and patient survival. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that can inform early detection and treatment decisions.

Project Overview
Dataset: Habermanâ€™s Breast Cancer Survival Data
Objective: To perform EDA to understand key factors influencing patient survival, especially the impact of axillary lymph nodes.
Approach: Data cleaning, validation, univariate/bivariate/multivariate analysis, and visualization.

Key Insights
The number of positive axillary lymph nodes is a strong indicator of cancer spread.
Higher counts of positive nodes are correlated with lower survival rates.
Visualizations reveal clear patterns that help distinguish long-term survivors from non-survivors.

What Are Axillary Lymph Nodes?
Axillary lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped glands in the armpit (axilla) and part of the immune system.
A positive node means cancer has spread from the original tumor into the lymphatic system.
This is a critical factor in determining the stage, prognosis, and treatment plan for breast cancer.

Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn

Visualizations
The project includes visual plots such as:
Histogram & KDE plots of node counts
Box plots comparing survival status
Pair plots to observe feature interactions
Count plots to show categorical distributions

Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates that axillary lymph node involvement plays a significant role in breast cancer prognosis. EDA helped uncover patterns that could assist medical professionals in identifying high-risk patients early on.
